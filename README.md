## How to use this guide

This guide is designed to be used in a linear fashion, starting with the first lesson and working your way through to the end. However, feel free to jump around to the lessons that interest you the most - you can use it how **you** want to!

We recommend watching demonstration videos twice. First simply watch and the second try to follow along, trying the demonstrations yourself. After watching the videos and reading the text in each lesson, complete the activities at the end of each lesson. This will get you the most benefits from this guide.
